# Project 1 Requirements and Notes


## Project Requirements
You will build a web application, the subject is yours to choose, that meets the following criteria:

* You will decide on an MVP (Minimal Viable Product) and clear it with the instructors before starting
* It uses semantically correct HTML and has at least 2 html pages 
* It uses Bootstrap (or other CSS Framework, or none at all), along with any custom CSS you write. The app must be responsive at a mobile and a desktop breakpoint.
* jQuery recommended, not mandatory; but Javascript must be used 
* Must have at least one form where the user provides some kind of information 
* LocalStorage must be used for something
* Must use at least one API for data 
* Must use at least one new technology, library, etc...
* All code must clean and well-organized, with good file structure 
* No obvious bugs, no errors in dev console
* Frequent code commits by all members 
* The README file will be well-organized and have:
* Project description
* Team members 
* Screen shot 
* Link to deployed version on Github Pages 
* Final code must be deployed to Github Pages 
* Only one repo needs to be managed per group. 

## The presentation:
* It will last about 10-15 minutes
* It will be accompanied by a Google Slides doc 
* Every group member will have a turn at speaking
* You will discuss:
* Your initial idea and the MVP you decided on
* Your tech stack
* Challenges you faced 
* Things which went right; things you struggled with 
* Ideas for expansion
* Quick demo of the working site

## Final submission:
* Each member will submit a link to the shared repo, and to the Github pages
* (All members will be submitting the same two links)
* Each member will also submit a Peer Review form (coming soon). These reviews will be seen ONLY by instructional staff 

## Gary's Recommendations:
* Choose a group project manager, someone who will help facilitate progress and resolve conflicts of opinion. This does not need to be the "best coder" of the group. It should ideally be someone comfortable interacting with others 
* Be ambitious, but be prepared to adjust
* Do daily check-ins, called StandUps
* Allow time for testing and fixing the bugs that you inevitably find 
* TRY TO BREAK THE SITE
* Determine a drop-dead coding date/time 
* Verify the API you want to use is functional and will give you the data you want EARLY in the process
* Practice Git branching and merging EARLY to make sure everyone is at least somewhat comfortable with it 
* Try to hunt down your own bugs before bugging (hehehe) us  
Support each other and leave the drama at the door 

### ONE HOUR OF PLANNING IS WORTH FIVE HOURS OF CODE

## Rules For Group Projects
* EVERYONE is on cam and participates
* Everyone is ON TIME
* Everyone works on GROUP PROJECT WORK only
* Even if you don't think your skills equal those of others, do your best and find ways to contribute
* PUSH YOURSELF, both individually and as a group 
* Be honest with your teammates about your progress
* If any conflict arises among group members:
* Try to resolve on your own first
* Reach out to the instructor or TA soon thereafter
* Don't let anything fester that will prevent the group from finishing the project!
* Any cases of a team member being rude or otherwise inappropriate should be reported to instructional staff IMMEDIATELY


## Tips For Group Git Work
* No one works in the same file at the same time 
* Initially, work with multiple javascript and css files

### Notes: 
* Any library which requires you to install using npm (Node Package Manager) should be avoided for now. You'll learn that later.)
